  # message from you is printed. "msgownnick" specifies the styling of the
  # nick ($0 part in msgnick) and "ownmsgnick" specifies the styling of the
  # whole line.

  # Example1: You want the message text to be green:
  #  ownmsgnick = "{msgnick $0 $1-}%g";
  # Example2.1: You want < and > chars to be yellow:
  #  ownmsgnick = "%Y{msgnick $0 $1-%Y}%n";
