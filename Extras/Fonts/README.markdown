Fonts
=====
These fonts are from the [nerd-fonts][] project; but patched with [TransType][] so that they have
matching family names and appear in OS X's settings as a single font-family.

Iosevka
-------
I built my own Iosevka, with these options:

    brew install iosevka --with-ss05 --with-ligset-coq --with-asterisk-low --with-slab

Install as follows, on a Mac:

   cp -fr ./Extras/Fonts/Iosevka ~/Library/Fonts/
