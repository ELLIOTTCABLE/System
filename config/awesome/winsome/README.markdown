Winsome
=======
An awesome theming library for [awesome][].

  [awesome]: <http://awesome.naquadah.org/> "awesome window manager"

Usage
-----
Simply clone this into your awesome configuration directory:

    cd ~/.config/awesome
    git clone git://github.com/elliottcable/winsome.git

Winsome themes go into a `themes` directory below your awesome configuration directory:

    mkdir -p ~/.config/awesome/themes
    cd !$
    # git clone a://url.to/a/theme.git
    git clone git://github.com/elliottcable/wool.git

Creating themes
---------------
Winsome sets up some sensible theme defaults, so your theme only needs to change the values that matter to it.

Your theme should also include a `backgrounds` directory with some desktop pictures.
